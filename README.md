# Racing-Line-Simulator
This is a really basic simulator I did when I joined UGR and was invovled in coding path planning for a kobuki robot.
I used this as a way to visualise the line that could be produced using different algorithms.
The current alogrithm is very slow with it making a complete graph of all the cones and finding the mid points of each of
the lines.
This is currently really slow and does not produce the best line I have plans to change the files in the future
